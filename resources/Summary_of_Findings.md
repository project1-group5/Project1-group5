Summary of Major Findings:

* With so many people moving to Austin in the last five years...

* Where is most of the real estate development work is happening?
  1. Most of the work is concentrated around the city center and the immediately adjacent areas. The most development in recent years is occurring in areas South of the river along the IH35 corridor.

* What is the comparison of Commerical vs. Residential development?
  1. Commercial development projects are holding steady around an average of 16000 permits per year.
  3. There are far more residential development projects than there are commericial; about 3X as many in 2017.
  2. The number of residential development projects are rising. Since 2015 there have been about 5,000 additional projects per year. There have nearly been as many residential projects in the first 3 quarters of 2018 as there were for all of 2015.

* How has the amount of new vs. remodel construction work changed in the last five years?
  1. Overall when looking at the completed/finalized permits for the last five years in Austin, the amount of new construction increased in 2016 and 2017 after staying at the same level from 2013 through 2015. While the amount of remodel completed permits has gradually decreased each year since 2013.
  2. Of the new construction permits that were finalized, new residential has continued to increase yearly while new commercial has stayed relatively flat over the years.
  3. Of the remodel construction permits that were finalized, there has been more commercial remodeling completed than residential remodeling. But both residential and commercial remodeling work has been decreasing yearly.

* As an extension of our first big question above (Where is most of the real estate development work is happening?), we also asked what areas/zip codes are condos being built in, for the most part? 
  1. A small majority (about 54%) of new condos over the last 5 years are being built in South and South East Austin; 6 of the top 9 areas based on zip codes are in this region.
  2. More specifically, 78748 is the most popular zip code for building new condos, and it is located in South S. Austin. 78745 is 3rd highest, and is just to the north of 78748, squarely placed in S. Austin. Moving just east of 78745, is 78744, and this zipcode had the 7th most condos; just north of 78744 is 78741, the 4th highest zipcode, located directly between the airport and downtown. On the edge of South Austin, just south of 78748, bordering the town of Manchaca is 78652 which had the 8th most condos. In 9th place was 78704, which is South Central Austin, and one of the more expensive zipcodes.
  3. Three other zipcodes that were in the top 9, representing 25% of the total were all in North Austin.  In 2nd place overall was 78717 which is between Cedar Park and Brushy Creek, just west of Round Rock. 78726 in 5th place overall is a zip code just S. of Cedar Park, and just E. of the western edge of Lake Travis. And finally 78660 was in 6th place, which is Pflugerville on the NE edge of Austin.
  4. In an article titled: “Austin and 3 suburbs boom among the nation’s fastest-growing cities,” from 5/24/18 (http://austin.culturemap.com/news/city-life/05-24-18-austin-suburbs-fastest-growing-cities-census-report/), we can see over a period from July 1st, 2016, to July 1st, 2017, Austin was the 12th fastest growing large city in the country, with just under a million people. Three N. Austin suburbs were also in the top 15 of this list, including Pflugerville in 3rd place, Cedar Park in 13th place. Georgetown, north of Round Rock, was in 6th place.  This growth in N. Austin explains why condo builders are looking around these burgeoning suburbs.
    Numbers:
    4454 total condo projects for these 5 yrs
    2402 in S. Austin…54%
    1118 in N. Austin…25%
